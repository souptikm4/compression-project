---

Compression Project is an interactive web application that demonstrates the principles of data compression through music and visual art. Users can generate melodies using Huffman coding, create rhythmic drum patterns with Run-Length Encoding (RLE), and design graphical avatars based on these algorithms. The application provides a hands-on experience of how data compression techniques can be applied creatively in various domains.
